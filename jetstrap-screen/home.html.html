            FactionsHC is a Hardcore PvP Factions server where if you die you are
            banned for 12 hours. With a balanced and fair setup that rewards skill
            instred of time played or hacking, the server has a deep and rewarding
            economy driven by the players themselves and based on real economics. We
            have a 24/7 hosted server with 2GB of RAM. We are working on getting a
            dedicated population and active community, but we have international, experienced
            and professional staff, and dedication to our players.
